NEXT IDEA:
 Some big battle. You join one side. Perhaps Alex is there, too?

What if you are imprisoned and others free you and arm you, such that you can join the
uprising?

Or what if Alex and others plan an attack on the raiders? Alex can vouch for you. You
join them. During the battle, those killed respawn off-camera. The battle continues until you make it to the raiders' leader and slay him, or until you leave

Also, things should happen besides fighting?

What if YOU are the one sent to get medicine?

Large stones

SPECIFIC INCIDENTS:
  Find the item someone left behind in the ruined city (which is occupied by monsters)
  Rescue someone's child, lost somewhere
  Sneak around in some place, possibly to assassinate someone

*to determine if a guard can see you, use line-of-sight.
To determine line-of-sight, use an area with only rectangular obstructions,
and PRECALCULATE!

temple? temple with courtyard and fountain? What if you are followed there by the woman
whose brother you killed?

Find a medicinal herb?

NEWER IDEA:

Have pre-designed "quests," but their location and geography are randomized.
  Slay the monster occupying an area (initial tutorial quest) (done)
  Find an item someone dropped and return it to them (possibly in the abandoned city?)
  A place is attacked. Escape alive. Fight or not; just survive
  Teamed with others, reclaim an area occupied by invaders
  Sneak in and do something without being caught

You should have to find something
