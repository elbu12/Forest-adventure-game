/**
Unlike PathNodes, MazeNodes know their neighbors (nodes to which they connect).
MazeNodes are used to build "mazes." Unless the map is expected to change
during the game, MazeNodes should only be used when the game begins, to
build a maze into the map.

Each MazeNode represents a single contiguous area (not necessarily a single
tile). A collection of MazeNodes can be given to the MazeNode class' static
"explore" method, which will then "explore" the maze, beginning at the
first node in the collection. The boolean returned represents whether
every node in the collection can be reached, starting from the first.

The "explore" method's purpose is to verify that each part of the maze
can be reached from each other part. If the return value is false, then
some part(s) has been isolated.

This information is stored internally in an adjacency matrix.
